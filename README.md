## Summary

This is my take on a simple and compact Gameport to MIDI Out adapter, to suit the requirements of your average retro DOS gamer using 1990's soundcards. The project became slightly less simple when I decided to add a switchable Activity LED to it. Then even more unsimpler when I further realised that it couldn't possibly do without a 3D-printed case.

Both extras are entirely optional - if you populate the board with only U1, R1, R2 and C1 (plus the connectors) you'll have a perfectly functioning Gameport to MIDI Out adapter with no frills.

This adapter's Gameport connector is in-line with the PCB, which maximises clearance to other ports and slots.
